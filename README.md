- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### ⚙️ Installation and Run Locally

**Step 0:**

Note :bangbang: the application uses Clerk for Authentication and User Management, therefore, you need to create Clerk account [here](https://clerk.dev/) and sets the `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variables in `.env` file. Also, the different URLs for the Clerk sign-in, sign-up, after sign-in and after sign-up pages.

Note :bangbang: the application uses a MongoDB database, therefore, you need to create a database and connect it to the application, for this, change the `MONGODB_URL` environment variable in `.env` file located in `server` folder.

Note :bangbang: the application uses TinyMCE, therefore, you need to create TinyMCE account [here](https://www.tiny.cloud/) and sets the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TINYMCE_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env` file.

Note :bangbang: the application uses OpenAI API, therefore, you need to create OpenAI account [here](https://openai.com/) and sets the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env` file.

Note :bangbang: the application uses RapidAPI, therefore, you need to create RapidAPI account [here](https://rapidapi.com/), subscribe to the [JSearch API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch/) and sets the `RAPIDAPI_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env` file.

## 🔒 Environment Variables

Environment variables[^12] can be used for configuration. They must be set before running the app.

> [Environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) are variables that are set in the operating system or shell, typically used to configure programs.

**DevOverflow** uses [Clerk](https://clerk.com), [TinyMCE](https://uploadthing.com/), [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com), [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) and [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) as external services. You need to create an account on each of these services and get the required credentials to run the app.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<CLERK_SECRET_KEY>
NEXT_CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINY_EDITOR_API_KEY=<YOUR_TINY_EDITOR_API_KEY>
MONGODB_URL=<YOUR_MONGODB_URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=<YOUR_SERVER_URL>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
RapidAPI_Key=<YOUR_RAPID_API_KEY>
RapidAPI_Host=<YOUR_RAPIDAPI_HOST>
```

## 🚀 Deployment

#### Deploy to production (manual)

You can create an optimized production build with the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Deploy on Vercel (recommended)

The easiest way to deploy this Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).
